A collection of programs and games written by me for the Atari 2600 ([processor 6502](http://6502.org/users/obelisk/6502/instructions.html)).
The purpose of this code was to teach myself the basics of assembly. The code can be run using a [Stella](https://stella-emu.github.io/) emulator, or on [8bitworkshop](https://8bitworkshop.com/)
